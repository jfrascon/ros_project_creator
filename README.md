## Description

The `ros_project_creator` package provides scripts for creating and configuring ROS projects and setting up VSCode development environments.

## Installation of the package `ros_project_creator` as a user

The package `ros_project_creator` is installed using **[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**, an extremely fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. `uv` provides better dependency resolution, caching, and performance compared to traditional `pip`.

This tool helps you create reproducible ROS projects with Docker and VSCode integration.

### Prerequisites

* Linux (tested on Ubuntu)
* Git installed
* Python â‰¥ 3.8
* `curl` installed
* A Bash or Zsh shell

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone this repository** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jfrascon/ros_project_creator.git
   cd ros_project_creator
   ```

2. **Install `uv` and `uvx`**
   These tools are used to manage isolated Python environments and install packages cleanly:

   ```bash
   mkdir -vp "${HOME}/.local/bin"
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env XDG_BIN_HOME="${HOME}/.local/bin" UV_NO_MODIFY_PATH=1 sh
   ```

3. **Add `${HOME}/.local/bin` to your shell's `PATH`**
   (Only once, if not already present):

   ```bash
   # For Bash
   echo '[[ -d "${HOME}/.local/bin" && ":${PATH}:" != *":${HOME}/.local/bin:"* ]] && export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.bashrc

   # For Zsh
   echo '[[ -d "${HOME}/.local/bin" && ":${PATH}:" != *":${HOME}/.local/bin:"* ]] && export PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. **Install `ros_project_creator` locally**:

   This installs the tool under `${HOME}/.local`:

   ```bash
   uv pip install --system --prefix "${HOME}/.local" ./ros_project_creator
   ```

5. **Restart your terminal**:

   Close and reopen your terminal to apply changes to your environment.

Check if the scripts inside the package `ros_project_creator` are found in your system.

```sh
pip list --user | grep ros_project_creator
ros_project_creator        1.0.0

which create_ros_project
~/.local/bin/create_ros_project

which create_vscode_project
~/.local/bin/create_vscode_project
```

## Running the scripts inside the package `ros_project_creator` as a user

Once installed, you can run the scripts inside the package `ros_project_creator` directly from the command line.

### **create_ros_project**

This script creates a structured ROS project based on predefined templates.

```sh
```

### **create_vscode_project**

This script initializes a VSCode workspace.

```sh
> create_ros_project -h
usage: create_ros_project [--img-id IMG_ID] [--no-vscode] [--no-pre-commit] [--no-console-log]
                          [--log-file LOG_FILE] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL] [-h]
                          project_id project_dir ros_distro base_img platform img_user

Creates a new ROS project based on templates

positional arguments:
  project_id             Short, descriptive project identifier for internal reference (e.g. 'robproj')
  project_dir            Path where the project will be created (e.g. '~/projects/robproj')
  ros_distro             ROS distro to use: noetic (ros1), humble (ros2), jazzy (ros2)
  base_img               Base Docker image to use (e.g. 'ros:humble')
  platform               Platform to use for the resulting Docker image (e.g. 'linux/amd64').
                         Supported platforms:
                           linux/amd64    - 64-bit x86_64 (e.g. Intel/AMD PCs and servers)
                           linux/arm/v7   - 32-bit ARMv7-A (e.g. Raspberry Pi 2/3 with 32-bit OS)
                           linux/arm64    - 64-bit ARM (e.g. Raspberry Pi 4)
  img_user               Active user to use in the resulting Docker image

options:
  --img-id IMG_ID        ID of the resulting Docker image (e.g. 'robproj:humble'). If not set, defaults to '<project-id>:latest'
  --no-vscode            Do not create VSCode project
  --no-pre-commit        Do not use pre-commit hooks
  --no-console-log       Disable logging to console. Console logging is enabled by default
  --log-file LOG_FILE    File to log output
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL  Logging level (Default is DEBUG)
  -h, --help             Show this help message and exit
```

## Uninstalling the package `ros_project_creator` as a user

If you need to uninstall the package `ros_project_creator`, run the following command:

```sh
uv pip uninstall --system --prefix ~/.local ros_project_creator
```

To ensure the package is completely uninstalled, run:

```sh
pip list --user | grep ros_project_creator
```

If no output appears, the package has been successfully removed.

If the commands `create_ros_project` or `create_vscode_project` are still available after uninstallation, remove them manually:

```sh
rm -f ~/.local/bin/create_ros_project
rm -f ~/.local/bin/create_vscode_project
```

Then, verify that the scripts are no longer accessible:

```sh
which create_ros_project

which create_vscode_project

```

## Installation of the package `ros_project_creator` as a developer

### 1. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Install the package `ros_project_creator` using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

Install the package `ros_project_creator` in a virtual environment, using the `--editable` flag, so the installed scripts will be linked to the source scripts.
This way, any change in the source code will be reflected when executing the scripts for debugging purposes.

```sh
git https://github.com/jfrascon/ros_project_creator.git ~/ros_project_creator
uv venv ~/.venv
source ~/.venv/bin/activate
uv pip install --editable ~/ros_project_creator
deactivate
```

### 3. Verify the installation of the package `ros_project_creator`

Check if the scripts inside the package `ros_project_creator` are found in your virtual environment.

```sh
source ~/.venv/bin/activate
which create_ros_project
  ~/.venv/bin/create_ros_project

which create_vscode_project
  ~/.venv/bin/create_vscode_project
deactivate
```

## Uninstalling the package `ros_project_creator` as a developer

If you need to uninstall the package `ros_project_creator`, run the following commands:

```sh
source ~/.venv/bin/activate
uv pip uninstall ros_project_creator
which create_ros_project

which create_vscode_project

deactivate
```
